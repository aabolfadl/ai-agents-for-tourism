    "description": "The oldest submerged Harbor which located in red sea governorate dated to 2600 B.C - its construction approximately takes a form of LShape. The sea port consists of the remains of water installations in the form of the Latin letter L with a slightly spherical angle. Today, part of it appears on a small rocky head, then extends eastward to about 160 m and then extends irregularly to the south-east for about 130 m. The width of this building is between 8 m and 14 m and is deposited in water that does not exceed the depth - currently - two meters. It is likely that this building was constructed to serve as a barrier to the northern waves and currents to provide a large water area where ships can dock and depart safely. The water area occupied by the inland basin of the old port is estimated to be at least 5.67 ha. The site's function as a seaport is confirmed by the finding of 21 limestone anchors dating back to the 4th Dynasty, about 120 meters from the present beach and about 11 meters south of the wave barrier. There is no doubt that the discovery of the port, which dates back to the era of King Khufu, the most famous of the kings of the fourth family (about 2600 BC) in the location of the valley of the shelf is one of the most important scientific events in the modern era; because it contains the oldest facilities of the port known industrial so far in the world, This port is that the ancient Egyptians had experienced the establishment of sea ports since the fourth family at least, and formed a network between the Red Sea coast and the Sinai Peninsula.",

    "description": "The site lies at a depth of 6–8 m, covering an area of 2.25 ha in Alexandria. It dated to the Greco-Roman period but it includes artifacts from the Pharaonic period. Some of these artifacts are the remains of the lighthouse itself and the rest were brought from the Serapeum and thrown at the entrance of the harbor to prevent the entry of enemy fleets in the twelfth century A.C. Most important discoveries: - At a depth from 6 to 8 meters more than 3000 pieces were located, including statues, sphinxes, and columns of different shapes, capitals and bases of columns and parts of obelisks. - Blocks from different sizes and weights (some of them weighing75 tons). The artifacts’ materials aresuch as: granite, calcite, quartzite, limestone, sandstone and greywacke. - North of Qaitbay three wrecks were located. No wood remained, but amphorae, daily utensils as well as metal and stone anchors were found. The wrecks span from the third century BC to the seventh century AD. - fourth wreck was located to the west, carrying blocks of limestone probably from EI-Mex quarry, some 10 km west of Qaitbay, that were likely intended for construction purposes in Alexandria.",

East of the Eastern Harbor of Alexandria, from Cape Silsileh to sidiBishr promontory. Most important discoveries: - Many site were discovered at El-Hassan reef,Chatby,Ibrahimieh,Sporting EL-Kour islets and BirMas’oud. - A large number of amphorae, concreted on the seabed, cover the El-Hassan reef and its contours marking the location of several shipwreck -Two sites were discovered in Shatby , and one is the sub-merged part of cape Silsileh that formed part of the Royal Ptolemaic quarters - 400 architectural elements of various stones lie on the seafloor - At Ibrahimieh, two sites have also been discovered. Some 50 small- and medium-size stone anchors dating to the Islamic period were raised from the first site that lies on a large reef at 13–15 m depth, 450 m from the shore. The second site lies in the shallows and consists of a large stone quarry, some shaft tombs as well as a complex grid of fish tanks. - At El-Dahab, El-Kour islets and BirMas’oud promontory demonstrated that these three sites and the submerged areas between them formed a large necropolis dating to the Graeco-Roman period. - -Numerous stone anchors and fishing tackle was found on the seabed north of El-Kour islet.\nfor brochure Downlod here",

    "description": "The Mamoura Bay at Alexandria is a vast bay stretching from the royal Montaza gardens in the west to the gulf of Abu Qir in the east. The bay was the gateway to the ships coming from the Mediterranean on their way to the Nile. By hugging the coast of the bay, the ships traveled to the Canopic branch of the Nile and transported their goods to all of Egypt.\nPottery sherds and amphorae were found scattered on the bay’s seabed, a testament to the many shipwrecks that took place here. The artifacts testify to the flourishing trade between Egypt and the world. A survey of the seabed revealed an ancient Roman shipwreck, remains of which are still present today.\nLittle is known about Mamoura Bay, but excavations are gradually providing us with information on the area. A small port and paving dating to the Greco-Roman Period were found, along with the limestone quarry that was used to build them.\nRock cut basins were also discovered and are thought to be evidence of fish farming, raising the possibility of a settlement that was once located here.",

    "description": "Saadana Island, on the Red Sea coast north of Safaga in Red Sea governorate, is home to a shipwreck that offers us a rare glimpse into 18th Century trade. This area in the sea is difficult to navigate due to its shallow waters and multitude of corals, which is probably the reason the ship sank in the 1760’s.\nThe ship was 50 meters long and was carrying about 900 tons of cargo. Excavations revealed that the ship was carrying Chinese Qing Dynasty porcelain that was fashioned for the Middle East. Many spices were also found aboard the ship including pepper, cardamom and nutmeg from India; frankincense from Oman; as well as, coconuts, olives and hazelnuts among other things.\nThe ship does not resemble other ships from this period, and so its origin remains unknown. However, its contents shed light on the intensive and far reaching trade that occurred during this time, and Egypt’s ports as the link between the east and the west.",

    "description": "Founded by Alexander the Great, Alexandria was once a thriving city among the most prominent cities in the ancient world, and the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt. The eastern harbor was the royal port of Alexandria and once had palaces, temples and the legendary Pharos Lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Today, the remains of the city have been submerged under the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe most prominent monument from the harbor was the Pharos Lighthouse that was commissioned by Ptolemy I Soter I in 297 B.C, and that was a landmark in the ancient city. The lighthouse stood 130 meters tall and had a beacon that guided ships to the port from up to 50 kilometers at sea. The beacon consisted of a fire that was reflected off of a massive bronze mirror. The lighthouse deteriorated with time and after an earthquake in the 14th Century, it collapsed.\nRecent excavations at the harbor discovered a marble floor believed to be part of Cleopatra’s palace. A temple to Isis, sphinxes and statues were also found at the harbor submerged on the seabed. Continued excavations at the site will undoubtedly reveal a lot more.",

    "description": "The two cities Canopies and Heraklion occupied their position in Abu Qir Bay before the construction of Alexandria. They were very prosperous and derived their wealth from taxes levied on goods brought into nearby ports to be carried to the Nile.\nThe ruins of the two cities are recently discovered, as parts of a temple and statues of deities appeared, and the archaeological evidence indicates their collapse in the fourth century BC and their drowning in the sea, but the mystery surrounds the details of their fall. Eighteenth-century travelers used to search along the ancient ports hoping to find the remains of the two stricken cities.\nTo this day, it is not known exactly what catastrophe led to their disappearance, as some have suggested that an earthquake or a flood led to their demise.",

    "description": "During ancient times, the Nile was the primary mode of transportation in Egypt. Massive stones were transported on ships from quarries in the south intended for tombs, temples and other monuments in the north.\nAswan had two quarries that were extensively used; granite was brought from Aswan, and sandstone from Gebel El Silsila.\nThe journey undertaken by the ships carrying such heavy loads was not always successful, and some sunk in the Nile. In addition, some massive stones fell during their transfer onto the ships and now lie in the river’s depths. A quay for the transport of the heavy stones has been identified at Elephantine, called El -Ahly Quay, and is believed to have been one of the primary quays used. A smaller quay was also found at El Naga El Bahari.",
