    "description": "The Temple of Khonsu, nestled in the southwestern corner of the Karnak temple complex in Luxor, dedicated to the moon god Khonsu, a significant deity in ancient Egyptian mythology. Construction began under the reign of King Rameses III on the ruins of an earlier temple from the 18th Dynasty. Over time, the temple was enhanced, particularly during the reign of King Nectanebo II and the Ptolemaic period.\nThis temple exemplifies the classic design of ancient Egyptian religious structures. Measuring approximately 73 meters in length and 29 meters in width, it comprises a series of architecturally distinct sections. Visitors would first encounter the outer gateway, or pylon, which opens onto a processional avenue flanked by sphinx-like statues. Although time has reduced these statues to their bases, they remain a testament to the craftsmanship of King Nectanebo I during the 30th Dynasty. Beyond the pylon lies the first courtyard, a square hall bordered on three sides by rows of round columns with capitals shaped like closed papyrus buds.\nFrom this courtyard, a passage leads to the Hypostyle Hall, a structure featuring eight columns arranged in two rows. The columns’ capitals alternate between closed and open papyrus buds, adding visual interest to the hall. This section, dating back to the reign of King Seti I, is thought to include remnants of the earlier temple. The Hypostyle Hall transitions into a rectangular chamber that once housed the Sanctuary, now largely destroyed. Remarkably, a sandstone statue of Khonsu, believed to date to the reign of King Tutankhamun, was discovered here. Beyond this chamber is the Sacred Boat Shrine, a smaller room supported by four columns. At its center lies the base for Amun’s sacred boat, from the era of King Rameses III.\nSignificant modifications to the temple were undertaken by later rulers. King Nectanebo II rebuilt the gateways of the Hypostyle Hall, while the Ptolemaic rulers extensively renovated and expanded the structure, incorporating stones from the older temple into their designs.\nKhonsu, as part of the Theban Triad alongside Amun-Ra and Mut, held a revered place in Egyptian belief. Representations of Khonsu often depict him as a child with a distinctive side braid or as a robed figure holding a scepter, crowned by the full moon resting on a crescent. His association with the moon imbued him with a reputation as a healer and protector, capable of expelling evil spirits—a trait that ensured his enduring popularity.",

    "description": "King Ramses II (c.1279-1213 BC), the most famous king of ancient Egypt (who fought a battle against the Hittites), built the Ramesseum Temple, a funerary temple built of sandstone, the temple served as a model for future temples built by different kings.\nIt consists of the first pylon, which is a large building facing four flagpoles, while the inner one competly inscriped with the famous Battle of Kadesh. This pylon follows the first courtyard, which is currently demolished, and has two rows of columns on its southern side, while on the northern side there was a row of Osirian columns. As for the second pylon, to the left there are the remains of a huge black granite statue of Ramses II. The second courtyard is higher than the first one, but it is also demolished and has rows of columns and Osirian columns. After that comes the Hall of Columns with six rows of columns.\nThe temple is surrounded by many chapels dedicated to various deities, in addition to other buildings such as bakeries, kitchens, warehouses.\nThe entire complex is essential to understand the importance of Ramses II in Egyptian history and to admire one of the most important moments in Pharaonic architecture and art.\nThe walls of the Ramesseum were decorated with prominent banks depicting the king fighting his enemies in the Battle of Kadesh, in addition to depicting religious and funerary ceremonies and rituals.\nIt was also designed with its majestic columns and its huge statues, including the statue of Ramses II, which is more than 17 meters high and weighs about 1000 tons.\nThis complex was not known until the 18th century, that Frederick Ludwig Norden described the ruins. Later, the scientists who accompanied the expedition of Napoleon's army between 1798 and 1801 would also document the site. In 1829, it was visited by Champollion, who gave it the contemporary name of Ramesseum.",

    "description": "Ramses III built his mortuary temple, also known as the Temple of Medinet Habu, which is considered an architectural masterpiece due to its beauty and good state of preservation. It was dedicated to performing his funeral rituals, as well as to performing the rituals of worshiping the god Amun. This temple was built according to the usual traditions of temple construction in this era and is largely inspired by the Ramesseum.\nKing Ramses III (c.1184-1153 BC) is the most famous king of the Twentieth Dynasty, who fought many wars against the Libyans and the Sea Peoples, which led to years of prosperity in Egypt, but in the end, he fell victim to a conspiracy by the royal harem in the late days of his reign.\nThe temple is surrounded by a huge wall built of mud bricks with two guard rooms, and in the middle of the wall is a great gate surrounded by two towers with terraces and is known as the Gate of Ramses III or the High Gate, It is on the eastern side and there was a similar one on the western side but it was demolished. The eastern gate leads to the first pylon, then the first courtyard, then the second pylon and the second courtyard, then three halls of columns and a group of chapels, then the Holy of Holies and behind it a group of rooms. The temple also includes the remains of a royal palace, storehouses, temple administration buildings, and royal stables. It also contains many columns, some of which are round with papyrus-shaped capitals, and others represent Ramses III in the form of Osirians.\nThere is also in the area surrounding the temple a temple built by Queen Hatshepsut and King Thutmose III on the site of a temple built in the Twelfth Dynasty, which was built on the tombs of the ancestors of the god Amun, as well as the tombs of the divine wives of the god Amun-Ra, which date back to the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Dynasties.\nThere was a canal connected to the Nile, preceded by a dock. This canal allowed access to the temple by boats. The temple is surrounded by a huge wall built of mud bricks with two guard rooms. The area surrounding the temple was used by the inhabitants to protect themselves from attacks by Libyans from the west and to protect the temple. This is due to the political situation during the reign of Ramses III.\nThe decorations of the temple show Ramses III in military scenes such as the Libyan campaigns and battles against the Sea Peoples, as well as scenes of hunting and exploratory trips, in addition to religious scenes such as the king worshipping the deities, as well as various celebrations.",

These massive walls and towers were constructed with limestone.\nMost of the towers of the Citadel of Salah al-Din are situated in its northern enclosure. 18 tower some of which built during the reign of Salah al-Din are distinguishable by their semicircular shape, often enlarged in their diameter by al-Adil. Towers built entirely during the reign of al-Adil are rectilinear in plan. Within the towers are rooms on multiple levels that lead to perimeter embrasures for discharging arrows upon potential beseigers. Among these towers are al-Muqattam tower, Burg al-Suffa ('Alignment' Tower), Kirkilian tower, al-Turfa tower, Burg al-Muballat (‘Paved’ Tower), Burg al-Muqusar (‘Pavilion' Tower), Burg al-Ramla (‘Sand’ Tower), Burg al-Haddad (Blacksmith’s Tower), Burg al-Matar (‘Flight’ Tower used for pigeons), Burg al-Alwa (‘View’ Tower) and the Burg al-Sahra (‘Desert’ Tower). In addition, two towers named al-Imam flank the Bab al-Qarafa (Cemetery Gate).\nRestorations and additions to the northern enclosure and its towers’ continued in later eras beginning with the Mamluk Sultanate, and ending in the reign of Muhammad Ali and his dynasty. Military use of the area continued during the British occupation of Egypt. By the 80th of the 20th century, that area was opened to the public and developed as an archaeological garden and venue for cultural events.\nBurg al-Haddad\nThe Burg al-Haddad (Blacksmith’s Tower) is one of the most famous towers of Salah al-Din’s citadel (AH 567-589 / AD 1171-1193) and stands adjacent to al-Ramla Tower (‘Sand’ Tower), whose design it superficially resembles. The tower is built of limestone with a diameter of 22 metres and a height of 21.70 metres. It was originally built in a semicircular shape which was changed to a round-fronted design by an addition made by the Sultan al-Adil (AH 596-615 / AD 1200-1218).\nThe tower has two floors and the original interior plan of Salah al-Din consisted of a central groin-vaulted space with three embrasures leading to arrow slits. These arrow slits were converted into doorways by Sultan al-Adil that led to a semi-circular curving corridor from which five further rectangular vaulted halls radiated to the exterior of the tower on both the ground and upper floors. The exterior walls have machicoulis -  projecting windows from which liquids such as burning oil could be thrown on attackers from above.\nBurg al-Ramla\nBurg al-Ramla (the ‘Sand Tower’) is a corner tower located at the junction of the eastern and northern sides of the citadel’s enclosure wall. Baha al-Din Qaraqush supervised its construction during the reign of Sultan Salah al-Din Ayyub (AH 567-589 / AD1171-1193).\nThe tower is 20.80 metres high, and is built of limestone to a circular plan eighteen metres in diameter. It has two floors, each floor consisting of a central hall with three radiating vaulted chambers extending to the perimeter. Each chamber has a splayed narrow window embrasure through which weapons could be discharged.\nDuring the reign of Sultan al-Adil (AH 596-615 / AD1200-1218) the tower was expanded, and the window embrasures of each of the three radiating chambers were converted into door openings leading to rectangular vaulted rooms that ended in arrow slits. A corridor within the curtain wall of the enclosure connects the Burg al-Ramla with its immediate neighbour, the Burg al-Haddad (the ‘Blacksmith’s Tower’).",

    "description": "The first king of the 4th Dynasty, Sneferu (c. 2613–2589 BC), chose Meidum as the site of his royal tomb. What we see today bears little resemblance to the original monument, which was a step pyramid that was then transformed into a true pyramid with smooth sides.\nFor this and several other reasons, Sneferu’s reign was a pivotal point of the Old Kingdom, and the site of Meidum is an integral part, representing the developments in pyramid-building know-how, technology, and techniques that would then lead to the building of some of Egypt’s most famous monuments.\nAt Meidum, Sneferu began building a seven-step pyramid that would have been 65 metres high. This was then enlarged, possibly before completion, into an eight-step pyramid. These two phases are called E1 and E2 by Egyptologists. In a completed state, the E2 pyramid would have been 85 metres high with a base length of 120.75 metres. It was at this point that Sneferu built the massive Bent and Red Pyramids at Dahshur. He then transformed the eight-step E2 pyramid into a true pyramid (E3) which stood between 92 and 95 metres high, with a base length of 144 metres.\nToday, the pyramid has the appearance of a three-step structure emerging out of a massive mound of rubble and debris surrounding it. This tower is, in fact, most of the core of the pyramid. It was previously hypothesised that the rubble was the result of a sudden and catastrophic collapse that took place during the E3 construction phase. However, the debris consists of layers—strata—demonstrating that the erosion and destruction of the pyramid was, in fact, gradual.\nAccording to earlier scholarship, the Meidum pyramid was constructed by Sneferu’s predecessor, the last king of the 3rd Dynasty, Huni (c. 2637–2613 BC). This is no longer the consensus. Sneferu’s name appears in texts in Meidum, and the ancient name of this site was Djed Sneferu ‘Sneferu Endures.’ During the reign of Thutmose III (c. 1479–1425 BC) in the 18th Dynasty, the scribe Ankhkheperreseneb visited Meidum and wrote an inscription, saying that he had come ‘to see the marvellous temple of Horus Sneferu. He saw it, as if heaven were in it and in it the sun rose.’\nThe Interior of the Pyramid\nThe entrance into the pyramid is in its north face, as was the standard, but it is unusually around 15 metres above the ground. A descending passage goes from the masonry of the pyramid down into the bedrock, turning into a horizontal corridor. Going past two niches, this leads to a vertical shaft that goes up to the burial chamber. Its corbelled ceiling distributed the tremendous weight of the masonry above, preventing it crushing the open spaces within the pyramid. It is for this same reason that the ancient Egyptians built corbelled weight-relieving spaces just above the two niches and the lower part of the descending passage. These were only discovered in 1998. It is here in Meidum that corbelling for a stone ceiling appears for the first time, a technique that would later be used to outstanding effect in the Grand Gallery and the burial chamber in Khufu’s tomb—the Great Pyramid.",

    "description": "The Palace of Muhammad Ali Pasha (1220-1264 AH \\ AD 1805-1848), founder of modern Egypt, is a rare masterpiece that brings together elements of nature, architecture and art. The palace combines elements of European aesthetics with Islamic architecture. Its construction began in 1223 AH / AD 1808, when Muhammad Ali decided to build Shubra Suburb, which was the northern promenade of Cairo. The palace was completed in 1237 AH / AD 1821, spanning a vast area of fifty acres across a suburb on the east bank of the Nile in Cairo. Today, this suburb is called Shubra al-Kheima and the Muhammad Ali Palace has become known as Paradise Palace or Shubra Palace.\nThe architectural plan of the palace was centred within a massive garden that included clusters of buildings surrounded by a wall. Initially, the palace consisted of the Saraya al-Ekama (Residential Palace), Saray al-fasqiyya (Fountain Palace) and saray al-gabalaya. It also included a bird tower, boat harbour, Hydraulic wheel (Saqqyia) that provided the palace and its garden with water, and stables known as the Shubra Stables.\nThe style employed in the palaces took on the character of 19th century Italian and French aesthetics. This was also the first building in Egypt to incorporate a modern lighting system, when Muhammad Ali Pasha commissioned the English engineer Galloway to install lighting fixtures in the palace.\nThe palace underwent extensive restoration and was reopened in 2005, after which it witnessed several important events, providing a wonderful location for receiving official delegations. After 2011 it remained closed, but given its historical and artistic value, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, in cooperation with the Armed Forces Engineering Authority resumed restoration and development plans in 2018. The restoration work included floors and walls, raising the efficiency of the picturesque lake, restoring and maintaining inscriptions and decorations, in addition to linking the palace to the Nile pier for ease of movement for visitors",

    "description": "In 2015, a joint archaeological mission of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Lund University of Sweden began on the eastern side of Gebel al-Silsila. The project revealed a group of 78 tombs from the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BC) belonging to men, women, and children. Their genders and ages suggest that a settlement existed in the location of Gebel al-Silsila, rather than a temporary housing site for quarry workers as previously thought.\nThese simple tombs are undecorated rock-cut chambers that contained vessels, beer jars, faience beads and scarab amulets, bronze bracelets, and animal bones. The tombs were covered by the accumulation of sand over centuries and their state of preservation is poor due to heavy erosion and the rising water table. The excavation, preservation, and study of these tombs and their contents is important for our understanding of this unique site.",

    "description": "Many kings of the 19th Dynasty carved and dedicated stelae into the cliff-face at Gebel al-Silsila. It was at this narrow stretch of the Nile that the swelling of the river during the inundation was most apparent and was therefore considered a sacred location. These so-called ‘Nile Stelae’ commemorate offerings that were made to Hapy, god of the annual inundation of the Nile.\nThe 19th Dynasty tradition of carving Nile stelae at this spot began with Sety I (c. 1294–1279 BC). His son Rameses II (c. 1279–1213 BC) followed in his footsteps, and he, in turn, was followed by his own son Merenptah (c. 1213–1203 BC). Later, Rameses III (c. 1184–1153 BC) of the 20th Dynasty added his own stela.\nThe texts record how these kings ask the god Hapy to provide a good and safe flood for Egypt that will bring a plentiful supply of fish and birds. Agriculture in ancient Egypt was only possible thanks to the fertile soil deposited during the flood, and the kings acknowledge how the inundation, addressed in the form of the god Hapy, brings life to the Egyptian people.",

    "description": "The Monastery (Dayr) of Anba (Saint) Hadra is named after a local saint (Coptic: ⲁⲡⲁ ϩⲁⲧⲣⲉ / Apa Hatre) who lived in the late of the 4th and the beginning of the 5th century AD—first as a monk, and finally as the Bishop of Syene (Aswan). Every year on the 21st of December (the 12th of Kiahk in the Coptic calendar), a religious festival is held at the site on the anniversary of Anba Hadra’s death. Although it is known as the Monastery of Saint Simeon, the identity of this saint and his association with the monastery remain unknown.\nThe site is exceptional among historic monasteries in Egypt for the good state of preservation of its original structures built of stone and mud brick. Although the buildings slowly decayed after their gradual abandonment, the remaining architecture still gives a good idea of what a coenobitic monastery in Upper Egypt during the medieval era looked like. The evidence attests to religious activity here from the 6th to the beginning of 14th centuries.\nA high enclosure wall surrounding the monastery with two gates endows the monastery. The monastery extends over two levels—a lower and an upper terrace—divided by a rocky escarpment. On the lower terrace there is a church as well as a series of small cave-like spaces that were later used as a part of the monastery. The most prominent of these is the grotto that is attributed to Anba Hadra. The upper terrace is dominated by a two-storey residential building with communal cells characteristic of a coenobitic monastery, a refectory, areas for food storage, oil presses, and ovens and an extensive workshop area which allowed the monks to maintain their livelihood within the confines of the monastery.\nThe church and the grotto are notable for the remains of the colourful wall paintings that still decorate some of their walls and ceilings. Some of the monks’ cells on the upper level, along with parts of the church walls, are notable for the Coptic and Arabic graffiti left by visitors and the monks of the monastery.\nto download A Guide to Aswan click here!",

    "description": "This mosque was named after its founder, Sulayman Pasha al-Khadim, governor of Egypt during the reign of Sultan Sulayman the Magnificent. The mosque was constructed in 935 AH/ 1528 AD on the ruins of a Fatimid mosque. Sulayman Pasha’s mosque was the first Ottoman-style mosque built in Egypt, as it is surrounded by a wall and is led up to by means of a staircase from two sides. Its minaret ends with a pointed conical top in the shape of a pencil, while the entrance leads to an open courtyard, preceded by a prayer house.\nThe prayer house consists of a square area covered with a central dome, surrounded by three iwans covered with half-dome stone. The mosque’s marble pulpit is distinguished by exquisite floral and geometric decorations and a bench of the muezzin” dikkat al-mubaligh”.  As for the courtyard, on the northwest side of the prayer house, it consists of an open court surrounded by four canopies covered with shallow domes, including a sundial. In the northwestern portico, there is the dome of a mausoleum in which \"Abu Mansur Qasta\", the founder of the old Fatimid mosque, in addition to several marble structures and tombstones of mausoleums for notable figures from the Ottoman era.\nAdditions continued to the mosque during the era of Muhammad Ali Pasha, where he added the shed that precedes the western entrance.

    "description": "Sultan Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi commissioned his vizier, Baha al-Din Qaraqush, to build a well supplying the citadel with water in the southwestern side of al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun Mosque. The well was known as “Yusuf’s Well” after the name of Salah al-Din (Salah al-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub). It was also known as \"The Spiral Well\" and \"The Citadel’s Well\". It was dug at the same time as the castle building 572-589 AH / 1176-1193 AD.\nThe well is characterized by an architectural design with foreign influences. It was dug in the rock at a depth of about 90 m, and it consists of two floors, around which a spiral staircase, narrows at the bottom of it. On each floor, there is a water wheel that raises water by cattle, its walls contain apertures for lighting and ventilation.\nAccording to historians, the water that comes from the well was pure at the beginning, until Qaraqosh wanted to increase its water, so he expanded in digging the mountain, and a salty spring came out of it that changed its pureness. Hence, Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi constructed barrages to transport water from the Nile to the Citadel throughout the Ayyubid period to be continued in Mamluk period known as the Cairo Citadel Aqueduct.",

    "description": "Prisons spread throughout the castle as a first-class military facility. Historians mentioned the existence of more than one prison in the citadel, such as \"the great pit\" (the pit is a deep hole under the surface of the earth similar to a well and is accessed by stairs and closed by a door). There was a prison located next to the Mosque of Sulayman Pasha al-Khadim on the northern side of the citadel.\nAs for the current prison museum, it was established by Khedive Ismail after he transferred his government headquarters to Abdeen Palace in 1874 AD, to be expanded later by Khedive Tawfiq. The Military Police, the Military Police, took charge of prison affairs after the July 1952 Revolution. The Citadel Prison was famous for being the seat of the imprisonment of the most prominent public and political figures during the last century, which contributed later to its conversion into a museum and tourist attraction.\nIt consists of a 50-meter passageway that contains a group of cells divided into two sectors, one east and the other west. In addition, a group of rooms was dedicated to torturing prisoners forcing them to confess, which was simulated through wax statues. One of the most famous torture chambers; The \"Rings\" room, designed by the French \"Lemian\" during the reign of King Fouad in 1932 AD, is modeled on a room similar to the famous French \"Bastille prison\".",

    "description": "One of the oldest Mamluk mosques, Sultan Baybars al-Bunduqdari (658–676 AH / 1260–1277 AD) commissioned its construction on approximately 12,600 meters square of land in 665 AH / 1266 AD on what is today al-Zahir Square, and prayers were held there for centuries. Four riwaqs (arcades) surround a central courtyard, the largest of these is the qibla riwaq, Here, the space in front of the mihrab was covered by a massive dome as large as mausoleum of Imam Shafii. Unfortunately, this magnificent wooden dome collapsed a long time ago. The mosque has three entrances, each entrance surmounted by the foundation slab.\nThe mosque has suffered greatly throughout its long history. During the French campaign in Egypt, the mosque was transformed (1798 - 1801) into a military fort ,Cannons were set up on the walls of the mosque, and its minaret was used as a defensive tower until it was destroyed. In 1812 , some of the mosque’s columns were moved to al-Azhar Mosque. Subsequently, the British army used it as a Military warehouse and then a slaughterhouse until 1915 .\nStarting 1918, the Committee for the Preservation of Arab Antiquities repaired Some parts of the mosque, and undertook some restoration in the qibla riwaq .The Supreme council of Antiquities cooperated with Kazakhstan to restore the mosque, work went from 2007 to 2010, resumed in 2018, before reaching completion in 2022. Architectural and artistic elements were restored, as were wooden ceilings, and the foundations were reinforced. The groundwater water level was stabilised. New stone and marble flooring was installed in the mosque’s courtyard and arcades, during which an underground cistern was discovered beneath the courtyard.",

    "description": "Qaitbay Citadel is one of the most\nimportant forts on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Abu al-Nasr Qaitbay built it between 882 AH/ 1477 AD and 884/ 1479 AD over the ruins of Alexandria’s Lighthouse. It served as Alexandria’defence against naval attacks.\nThe citadel was made of limestone and spanned an area of approximately 17550 m2. An outer wall plotted with defence towers surrounds the building.\nAn inner wall surrounds the citadel’s courtyard and includes a number of rooms some of them used as barracks and others for storage.\nThe citadel’s entrance leads to the courtyard where we find the main tower located in the northwest. It consists of a massive three-floored square fort. Its four corners are occupied by half-circular towers that carry protruding balconies for the defence of the city. A tank near the tower supplied soldiers and their horses with water.\nQaitbay citadel drew the attention of rulers throughout the ages, on account of its strategic location. The building was also enlarged and subject to other conservation operations in 2003.",

    "description": "The site gets its name from Arabic kum ‘mound’, a term found in the names of many archaeological sites, and ‘Ombo’, which ultimately derives from ancient Egyptian Nubt, interpreted as meaning ‘the golden (city).’ The city’s temple is dedicated to two deities: the crocodile god Sobek, and the falcon god Har wer (Horus the Elder). Although an earlier temple once stood here already during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1069 BC), the present structure was built during the Graeco-Roman Period (332 BC–395 AD), with the earliest attested royal name in it being Ptolemy VI Philometor’s (180–145 BC). Most of the decoration was completed by Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos (80–51 BC).\nThe temple has a unique design. Because it is dedicated to two gods, it has two parallel axial passages running through its columned halls, terminating in two sanctuaries, one for each. The southern axis (on the right) is Sobek’s, and the northern (on the left) Harwer’s.\nSobek was a god of fertility associated with water, the inundation, and vegetation, worshipped here alongside his wife the goddess of love and motherhood Hathor and their son the moon god Khonsu. The god of kingship Horus is the son of Osiris and Isis and, as Harwer, he is in adulthood, victorious over Seth, the murderer of his father. He was worshipped here alongside his wife \"Ta senet nefret\" ‘The Perfect Companion’ and their son \"Pa neb tawy\" ‘The Lord of the Two Lands’.\nIn addition to beautiful column capitals, the temple of Kom Ombo also features fascinating scenes decorating its walls. Calendars list festivals and other cultic activity, along with their dates and accompanying rituals. During the Roman Period, in the 2nd century AD, a scene was carved featuring what are believed to be surgical instruments, demonstrating how sophisticated ancient Egyptian medicine was. In the centre of the very back of the temple, Sobek and Harwer can be been on their respective sides of the temple in a deeply symbolic scene, inspiring awe in ancient pious visitors to this sacred place.\nto download A Guide to Aswan click here!",
