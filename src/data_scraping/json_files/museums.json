    "description": "This museum was established inside Misr Public Library at Matrouh in cooperation with the Governorate to shed light on the city and its eventful history all over different eras proven from the outturn of the excavations of the area. It all began in the time of the pharaoh; there’s a probability that the northeastern part of the governorate has been part of the seventh Nome of Lower Egypt. Additionally, most of the city belongs to the Egyptian Nome which called \"Lubia\".\nMoving to the Roman era Matrouh was called \"Paraetonium\" and \"Amunia\" from the name of the god \"Amun\".\nThe total area of the museum is 728m² divided into two floors. It contains numerous artifacts that tell the story of the pharaohs, the way they secured their boarders and desserts by building forts and castles since the city was the western gate of Egypt, deserts' goddesses in addition to the importance of Marsa Matrouh in fishing, trade and its relation with its neighbors as well as astronomy, science and philosophy.",

    "description": "The Graeco-Roman Museum of Alexandria is one of Egypt's principal museums, the oldest building in Egypt to be architecturally designed for the purpose of preserving and displaying antiquities. Furthermore, it is the only museum fully dedicated to the antiquities and civilization of Egypt during the Greek and Roman eras.\nSince 1889, the Italian Giuseppe Botti sought to establish a museum for Alexandria that would protect its antiquities from displacement and destruction. He continued to work on that until the decision to establish the museum was issued on June 1, 1892. The museum began in a modest rented property, and Khedive Abbas Helmy II inaugurated it on 17 October 1892. Giuseppe Botti was its first director.\nSince its inception, the museum has sparked a cultural renaissance about interest in the city’s archaeological activities. Discoveries increased, and there became a pressing need for a new spacious building. On September 12, 1894, Nubar Pasha laid the cornerstone for the new museum to be built on land owned and adjacent to the Municipal Council. The new structure was designed by the architects Dietrich and Stenon in a neoclassical style. The construction process took one year, and it was inaugurated again by Khedive Abbas Helmy II on September 26, 1895.\nAfter Botti's death in October 1903, the management of the museum remained Italian, Evaristo Breccia took charge in April 1904, and Achille Adriani succeeded him from 1932 to 1940. from 1940-1947, the museum was run by Alan Rowe. from 1948 to 1953, Adriani took over management once more. Egyptian archaeologists have been in charge of the museum since 1953 onward.\nIn 1982, a development project was implemented for the museum, during which a new wing was added connecting the western and eastern wings. In September 2005, a decision was made to close the museum in order to carry out a comprehensive project to expand and develop the museum. The project stalled for ten years until work was resumed in April 2015. By creating an upper floor, a new interior design, and a new display scenario are applied.\nto download Graeco-Roman Museum brochure click here!",

    "description": "The idea for the National Museum of Suez was conceived after the collapse of the older museum during the war in 1967. Its collection was moved to the storage rooms of the Egyptian Museum, on Tahrir Square. The Suez National Museum was established to serve as a cultural beacon and a touristic landmark shedding light on the history of the Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The museum gives an account of the history of the city of Suez and its antiquities from prehistory to the modern era,The museum was opened on a trial basis in January 2012, but was not officially opened to the public due to the security conditions at that time. It was officially opened to receive visitors on September 29, 2014.\nThe museum consists of two floors separated by an open exhibition hall that displays different styles of Greek, Roman and Islamic archaeological columns.\nThe museum sheds light on the digging of the Suez Canal as well as other canals and their role in sea trade, such as the \"Canal of the Pharaohs\" dug by Nekau II. It also highlights the spheres of mining and shipbuilding, Egypt’s commercial relationships, and the important part that Suez plays in the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). In addition to this is the mummification hall is one of the most important halls of the museum, as it simulates the cemetery from the inside and contains a complete depiction of the mummification process, including mummification tools, votive plaques, offering tables, and a group of colored coffins, in addition to a mummy of a priest with a magic spell.\nOne of the most prominent objects is a statue of King Senwosret III dating to the Middle Kingdom (Twelfth Dynasty). The museum also includes a stela of the Persian king Darius I, one of four that he set up along the canal connecting the Nile with the Red Sea in commemoration of its excavation.\nThe museum also includes a library and an activities centre where different educational programs and events are held. The museum’s garden contains a modern replica of a ship from the reign of Hatshepsut (The New Kingdom,18th Dynasty) of the type that she used to send on trading expeditions to faraway lands.",

    "description": "This museum is the first of its kind to be devoted to the history of the Egyptian military through the ages. The museum was first located in the building of the Ministry of Defense in Falaki in 1937, after which it was transferred to another building in the neighborhood of Garden City in 1938, before finally being transferred to al-Haram Palace in 1949 in the Cairo Citadel in 1949. This palace, built by Muhammad Ali Pasha in the 19th century, was renovated and reopened in 1993. Through a variety of items on display including artifacts, replicas, scale models, and dioramas, the museum displays the development of weapons and military equipment and costumes. It also puts the spotlight on the most important battles and military figures in Egyptian history. Also, the museum’s open-air area displays several real tanks and aircraft that were used in the October 1973 war.",

The royal rest house was then converted into a museum, and in 2016 the Museum was reopened after renovation to the public. The museum displays a collection of objects that once belonged to the royal family including statues, souvenirs, and photographs and oil paintings of members of the royal family. The museum also houses a collection of replicas of the furniture discovered in King Tutankhamun’s tomb, moved here after their original location in King Farouk’s rest house near the Giza pyramids.

    "description": "The Nubian Museum was founded in response to the international salvage campaign of the ancient Nubian monuments initiated by UNESCO upon the request of the Egyptian government in 1960. Work on establishing the Nubian Museum began in the early 1980s when a committee was formed comprising of specialists from the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Egyptian universities, and UNESCO.\nThe task of designing the building was entrusted to the architect Dr. Mahmoud Al-Hakim, and the museum’s interior was designed by the Mexican engineer Pedro Ramirez Vazquez, whose job it was to exhibit the archaeological, historical, cultural, and environmental heritage of Nubia. The Nubian Museum was opened in 1997, with its distinctive architectural design clad in local sandstone and pink granite, reflecting traditional local Nubian architecture. In 2001 it was awarded the Agha Khan Award for Islamic Architecture.\nThe museum has three floors, exhibiting thousands of artefacts that shed light on the development of Egyptian and Nubian geographical, social, and cultural civilization. The main exhibition hall and diorama present the local traditions and handicrafts of Nubia. In addition to the exhibition galleries, the museum also holds a lecture hall, library, educational department, theatre, and an open amphitheatre for the presentation of Nubian folklore.\nThe garden attached to the museum serves as an open-air museum that includes a part of a Fatimid cemetery, a cave with prehistoric rock inscriptions, and a waterway symbolising the artery of ancient Egyptian civilization, the River Nile. A series of water channels demonstrates the relationship between the river and the Nubian village surrounded by plants that would have been common in ancient times. A reconstruction of a Nubian house offers a glimpse into the daily life of the Egyptians in Nubia.\nto download A Guide to Aswan click here!",

    "description": "The Egyptian Museum is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East, and houses the largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities in the world. The museum displays an extensive collection spanning from the Predynastic Period to the Greco-Roman Era.\nThe architect of the building was selected through an international competition in 1895, which was the first of its kind, and was won by the French architect, Marcel Dourgnon. The museum was inaugurated in 1902 by Khedive Abbas Helmy II, and has become a historic landmark in downtown Cairo, and home to some of the world’s most magnificent ancient masterpieces.\nAmong the museum’s unrivaled collection are the complete burials of Yuya and Thuya, Psusennes I and the treasures of Tanis, and the Narmer Palette commemorating the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under one king, which is also among the museum’s invaluable artifacts. The museum also houses the splendid statues of the great kings Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the builders of the pyramids at the Giza plateau. An extensive collection of papyri, sarcophagi and jewelry, among other objects, completes this uniquely expansive museum.",

    "description": "The Museum of Islamic Art contains one of the largest and most extensive collections of Islamic artifacts in the world. The idea of collecting and display the grand collection of artifacts began in 1880 AD. Eventually the building was established and inaugurated in 1903 AD, during the region of Khedive Abbas Helmy ll. The building’s facade was made in the Mamluk style and is adjacent to the National Library of Egypt.\nIn 2014, an explosion targeting the opposite building (Cairo Security Directorate), impacted the façade. It was restored and reopened in 2017. The museum’s building consists of two floors that exhibit a large selection of artifacts from all over the world, covering subjects such as astronomy, medicine, and architecture. The vast collection takes the visitor on a journey through all periods of Islamic history, displaying some of the most magnificent artifacts. These include finely carved woodwork, delicately decorated ceramics, and rare manuscripts.\nA Mamluk key to the Ka’ba in Mecca and a textile bearing the oldest Kufic inscription are among the museum’s most notable possessions.\nClick Here to Download the Brochure of the Museum.",

    "description": "The Coptic Museum houses the largest collection of Coptic artifacts in the world and was inaugurated in 1910. The museum was established through the efforts of Marcus Simaika Pasha, a prominent Coptic figure who was vested in the preservation of Coptic heritage. Simaika Pasha bought and collected Coptic antiquities and various architectural elements from older churches that were undergoing renovation, and used them to built the museum and establish its collection.\nThe collection represents Coptic history from its earliest beginnings in Egypt through to its rise as a leading center of Christianity in the world. Coptic Christianity traces its origins to a visit by Saint Mark in the city of Alexandria in the 1st Century A.D. The artifacts on display in the museum show the merge of Coptic art with the prevailing cultures including Pharaonic, Greek, Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman, and its evolution in developing its own character and identity.\nMagnificently decorated manuscripts, icons, delicately carved woodwork and elaborate frescos with religious scenes recovered from ancient monasteries and churches are among its extensive collection.",

The building was particularly adapted to preserve the cultural heritage of the royal carriages and all related material dating back to the era of Mohammed Ali Dynasty.\nThe idea of establishing the museum building dates back to the reign of khedive Ismail (r. 1863- 1879), who thought of founding a special structure for housing the horses and the khedivial carriages. Initially, the establishment was called the “Khedivial Carriages Service”, then its name was changed in 1922 to “Royal Stables Department (Royal Mews)” under the reign of king Fouad  (r. 1917- 1936).\nBeing the focus of royal attention, this establishment was provided with all specialized experts and skilled workers. The building was converted into a museum after the revolution of 1952.\nThe Museum houses a unique collection, of which the most notable are various sizes and types of royal carriages, one of the most distinguished objects in the Museum is the grand Alay Carriage, which is characterized by its finest workmanship and elaborate decoration. It was the gift of Emperor Napoleon III and his wife Empress Eugenie to Khedive Ismail on the occasion of the Suez Canal inauguration in 1869. King Faruk ordered its restoration and used it on the inauguration of the Parliament in 1942, also its contain horse riding equipments, uniforms of the Carriages Service employees, as well as oil paintings dating to the same era.\nWorthy of note is that few museums all over the world are specialized in exhibiting this kind of displays, for examples museums in Austria, France, Russia, and England.\nto download the museum brochure click here!",

    "description": "Geyer Anderson Pasha was an English officer who studied medicine in London. He was assigned as a doctor for the English military in 1904 and was deployed in Egypt in 1907.\nIn 1935, Geyer Anderson submitted a request to the Assembly of Preserving Arab Antiquities to live in the two houses and to furnish them in Islamic-Arabic style. He proposed to gather a collection of pharaonic, Islamic, and Asiatic antiquities. These antiquities would belong to the Egyptian people following his death or when he left Egypt permanently. The assembly agreed. When Anderson left the house in 1942, his request was granted, and the two houses came into the possession of the Assembly of Preserving Arab Antiquities, which converted the building into the Geyer Anderson Museum.\nThe house is a combination of two houses dating to the Ottoman period (16-17th century).\nThe first house was built by the scholar ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Hadad in 947 AH/ 1545 AD. Lady Amina bint Salem later owned it. The second house belonged to Hajj Muhammad ibn Salem ibn Jilmam al-Jazar in 1041 AH/ 1631 AD. Different families lived in it until it came under the ownership of a lady from Crete, and so the house became known as Bayt al-Kritlyya.\nfor the virtual tour click the link: https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=LCyv1zFUxiq&mpu=497&minimap=1",

    "description": "The Museum of Prince Muhammad Ali’s Palace in Manial is one of the most beautiful and important historical museum in Egypt. The museum exhibits an important period in the history of modern Egypt and is characterized by its architectural design. Its modern Islamic style merges with Persian and Mamluk elements. It was also inspired by Syrian, Moroccan and Andalusian motifs, as well as Ottoman style. The building thus harmonises between a number of Islamic architectural traditions.\nThe palace of Prince Muhammad Ali Tawfik was established between 1319- 1348 AH/ 1900-1929 AD and consists of an outer wall that surrounds the entrance to the palace. Inside the walls is the reception area, the clock tower, the Sabil, the mosque, the hunting museum, living quarters, the throne hall, the private museum, and the golden hall, in addition to the wonderful garden surrounding the palace.",

    "description": "The Royal Jewelry Museum displays the collectibles of the Egyptian royal family, founded by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1805 and continued to rule for 150 years, until 1952.\nZaynab Fahmi built the palace in 1919 in Zizinya, Alexandria. It served as the residence of Fatma al- Zahra’, daughter of Prince Ali Haider, a descendent of Muhammad Ali Pasha.  The palace serves as a striking backdrop to the magnificent possessions owned by the family. It uniquely merges between European and Islamic styles, reflecting the fine taste of the royal family whose paintings, gilded ceilings, and mosaics decorate the palace rooms. The palace consists of two wings, eastern and western, connected by a corridor. Each wing has a basement and two floors.\nThe possessions amassed by the family over the period of their rule are on display in the various halls. A diamond and emerald inlaid collar belonging to the founder of the dynasty, Muhammad Ali Pasha, is among the museum’s collection. The lavish lifestyle of the family is reflected in a gold chessboard, golden binoculars encrusted with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and gold cups inlaid with precious stones. Also on display are elaborate jewelry sets commissioned by the greatest designers in Europe, which once adorned the queens and princesses of Egypt’s royal family.",

    "description": "Mummification museum in Luxor (ancient Thebes), intended to provide an understanding of the process to preserve the body. The ancient Egyptians not only applied embalming to dead humans but also to many animals (Cats, dogs, crocodiles…. etc.). God Anubis(the Jackal) was the god of embalming and mummification.\nMummification process is believed to have taken around 70 days, accompanied by many rituals. The organs of the deceased were carefully removed through a small incision (10 cm) in the left side of the body and preserved in Canopic jars. The body was then dried in sodium nitrate, or nitrate salt brought from Wadi El Natron, for about 40 days, and finally wrapped in bandages of linen. Magical amulets were placed within the wrappings on various parts of the body to protect the deceased. The family then received the body and placed it in a coffin for burial.\nThe Mummification Museum provides a comprehensive view of the entire process through the display of many tools, objects and equipment used for the process, as well as, an explanation of the ritual and religious significance of the practice. Canopic jars, elaborately decorated coffins, mummified remains; amulets and statues of deities are among the many objects on display.",
